# UI Test Plan

These tests exercise the retained console behavior through Duke Level 10. Expected output blocks list fragments that must appear in order; the banner and divider lines may also appear in the actual console output. Each test case starts with an empty data file unless it explicitly restarts Yappy.

## Test Case 1: Add and List the Three Task Types

Aim: Verify that todos, deadlines, and events are added with the correct type icons and displayed by `list`.

Commands:
```text
todo borrow book
deadline return book /by 2026-08-30
event project meeting /from 2026-08-31 /to 2026-09-01
list
bye
```

Expected output fragments:
```text
Got it. I've added this task:
  [T][ ] borrow book
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] return book (by: Aug 30 2026)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
Got it. I've added this task:
  [E][ ] project meeting (from: Aug 31 2026 to: Sep 01 2026)
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
Here are the tasks in your list:
1.[T][ ] borrow book
2.[D][ ] return book (by: Aug 30 2026)
3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Aug 31 2026 to: Sep 01 2026)
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
```

## Test Case 2: Mark and Unmark Typed Tasks

Aim: Verify that inherited done-status behavior works for todo, deadline, and event subclasses.

Commands:
```text
todo read book
deadline submit report /by 2019-10-11
event orientation week /from 2019-10-04 /to 2019-10-11
mark 2
unmark 2
mark 3
list
bye
```

Expected output fragments:
```text
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
  [D][X] submit report (by: Oct 11 2019)
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
  [D][ ] submit report (by: Oct 11 2019)
Nice! I've marked this task as done:
  [E][X] orientation week (from: Oct 04 2019 to: Oct 11 2019)
Here are the tasks in your list:
1.[T][ ] read book
2.[D][ ] submit report (by: Oct 11 2019)
3.[E][X] orientation week (from: Oct 04 2019 to: Oct 11 2019)
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
```

## Test Case 3: Parse and Format Deadline Dates

Aim: Verify that a valid ISO deadline date is stored as a date and displayed in a friendlier format.

Commands:
```text
deadline do homework /by 2019-12-02
list
bye
```

Expected output fragments:
```text
Got it. I've added this task:
  [D][ ] do homework (by: Dec 02 2019)
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
Here are the tasks in your list:
1.[D][ ] do homework (by: Dec 02 2019)
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
```

## Test Case 4: Reject Unknown and Empty Todo Inputs Without Changing State

Aim: Verify that empty commands, unknown commands, and empty todo descriptions report errors and do not add tasks.

Commands:
```text
todo keep state

todo
blah
list
bye
```

Expected output fragments:
```text
Got it. I've added this task:
  [T][ ] keep state
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
OOPS!!! Please type a command.
OOPS!!! The description of a todo cannot be empty.
OOPS!!! I don't know what that means. Try todo, deadline, event, list, find, mark, unmark, or delete.
Here are the tasks in your list:
1.[T][ ] keep state
Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
```

## Test Case 5: Reject Invalid Deadline and Event Inputs Without Changing State
